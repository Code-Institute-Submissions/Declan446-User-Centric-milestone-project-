Frist Milestone Project

User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

UX:

My aim on this project was to promote the band AC/DC and their Music.
I was able to create a wedsite using the technologies i learned over the
past few months with Code Institute.

Features:

Nav bar: I used the same nav bar from the mini project with Bootstrap 4.
I also have links at the bottom off my wedsite to ACDC'S facebook,twitter
 and their official web store.

Testing:

I tested my website on a number of browsers,mobile devices and tablets to ensure
everything looks good on all screen sizes.

Technologies Used:

Html
Css
Bootstrap
Font awesome
Hover css

Credits:

Content:

I used most of my own content except the bands history on my about page. 
I got the content of my paragraph from ACDC'S Wikipedia page.

Media:

I copied my pictuces of the band from the official ACDC wedsite and resized them myself.

Acknowledgements:

90% of my layout and structure code(nav bar,header,footer) is from mini project with Bootstrap 4(Resume project).
I used alot of the code because i liked how it looked and how easy it was to get around the site.
I also used the code because i am not an expert on bootstrap yet and found it difficult to use.
I also copied the code from the ACDC official site for thr pictuces and layout of the band.
